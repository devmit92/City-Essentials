# City Essentials

## Description
City Essentials is a web/mobile application that looks to solve the problem of getting lost in the shuffle when trying to navigate a new city without missing out on the more local gems. It gives you a way of having a pulse on the city. Using Kansas City as a test market, the app allows users to get a list of the five hot spots based on what others actually using the app in that city think and it gives a complete list of all local gems from food, to fashion, to entertainment and whatever else you're looking for. Also users are able to interact on the community page and see what other users have to say about what's going on in Kansas City.

## Set up
1. Start off by creating a database named "city_essentials".
2. Run the queries that are stored in the "database.sql" file to populate the tables and insert the values you'll need. [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) needs to be installed, seeing that the project was built using it. Postico is recommended for running the queries.
3. Open up your editor and run "npm install" for this project.
4. In the terminal for this project run "npm run server" to start the server and "npm run client" to open a new browser window.

## Usage
1. Login or Register to gain access to the app.
2. Upon successful login or registration you'll land on the home page which displays the top 5 "hot spots" in Kansas City. Read up on each and click the expand arrow for more detailed information.
3. After checking out the "hot spots" you can click the link to the businesses page to get a full list of all of the local places to check out in Kansas City. On this page each business has a "star" feature. If you visit any of the businesses listed and you enjoy them, give them a star to help the "hot spots" list stay accurate in real time.
4. The last page you can navigate to is the community page. On this page users are allowed to leave comments or tips for other users to see. Also users can like other posts so you can see what other users really agree with or support.

## Roadmap
Future plans include adding in the Google API to give users their proximity to the business listed and direct them. Adding more cities is also in the plans for expanding the app.
